Many young people seem to enjoy tackling tough theoretical problems, but when the
time comes for application they are often disappointed to find that the theory is in
some ways irrelevant or inadequate to the problem at hand. At first this causes a
diminished interest in practical problems. But eventually many come to see the real
problems as more interesting than the original mathematical models.

The main use of reflection seismic imaging is petroleum prospecting. Unlike nuclear energy, 
hydrocarbons are a nonrenewable resource and there is evidence that petroleum production must 
decline during the lifetimes of the young generation. Does this mean that young people should 
avoid these studies? I think not. Taking the long-range view, with the population of the earth 
continuing to increase, it is not easy to imagine people losing interest in the earth's crust. 
A view of more intermediate range is that as the resource declines in abundance, there will be 
greater eorts to seek it. A short-range view is that workers are needed today, and there are no 
coal- or nuclear-powered airplanes. In any case, the skills developed in computer
implementations of concepts from physics, will always be of general utility.
